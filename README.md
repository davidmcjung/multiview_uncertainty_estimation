# MGP & MNP

This respository contains codes for [MGP](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/2ab3163ee384cd46baa7f1abb2b1bf19-Abstract-Conference.html) (NeurIPS 2022) and [MNP](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/839e23e5b1c52cfd1268f4023a3af0d6-Abstract-Conference.html) (NeurIPS 2023). As we do not own the preprocessed datasets presented in our papers, we do not publish the datasets here. Please contact the original authors to obtain the datasets and place in the data folder.
